Other ores will give you better outputs as well if you use a good enough head.\n\nEven coal, charcoal,bones, wheat, ender pearls, and charcoal non-ores will give bonus outputs.\n"}},"tasks":[{"partialMatch":1,"autoConsume":0,"groupDetect":0,"ignoreNBT":0,"index":0,"consume":0,"requiredItems":[{"id":"EnderIO:blockSagMill","Count":1,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""}],"taskID":"bq_standard:retrieval"}],"rewards":[{"rewardID":"bq_standard:choice","index":0,"choices":[{"id":"EnderIO:itemMachinePart","Count":1,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""},{"id":"enhancedlootbags:lootbag","Count":1,"Damage":5,"OreDict":""}]},{"rewardID":"bq_standard:item","index":1,"rewards":[{"id":"dreamcraft:item.CoinTechnician","Count":25,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""}]}]},{"questID":146,"preRequisites":[166],"properties":{"betterquesting":{"snd_complete":"minecraft:entity.player.levelup","taskLogic":"AND","partySingleReward":0,"visibility":"NORMAL","isMain":0,"simultaneous":0,"icon":{"id":"EnderIO:blockSliceAndSplice","Count":1,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""},"snd_update":"minecraft:entity.player.levelup","repeatTime":-1,"globalShare":1,"questLogic":"AND","name":"§9§lTorture device","isGlobal":0,"lockedProgress":0,"autoClaim":0,"isSilent":0,"desc":"When the subjects don't want to cooperate."}},"tasks":[{"partialMatch":1,"autoConsume":0,"groupDetect":0,"ignoreNBT":0,"index":0,"consume":0,"requiredItems":[{"id":"EnderIO:blockSliceAndSplice","Count":1,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""}],"taskID":"bq_standard:retrieval"}],"rewards":[{"rewardID":"bq_standard:choice","index":0,"choices":[{"id":"EnderIO:itemMachinePart","Count":1,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""},{"id":"enhancedlootbags:lootbag","Count":1,"Damage":6,"OreDict":""}]},{"rewardID":"bq_standard:item","index":1,"rewards":[{"id":"dreamcraft:item.CoinTechnicianI","Count":5,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""}]}]},{"questID":147,"preRequisites":[856],"properties":{"betterquesting":{"snd_complete":"minecraft:entity.player.levelup","taskLogic":"AND","partySingleReward":0,"visibility":"NORMAL","isMain":0,"simultaneous":0,"icon":{"id":"miscutils:RocketFuelMixA","Count":1,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""},"snd_update":"minecraft:entity.player.levelup","repeatTime":-1,"globalShare":1,"questLogic":"AND","name":"§9§lRocket fuel","isGlobal":0,"lockedProgress":0,"autoClaim":0,"isSilent":0,"desc":"Rocket fuel are used in the future for galacticraft rockets.

Get some crops (the sticks) and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. \n\nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdWdFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd \nFFFdddFFF\nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.\n\nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.\n\nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.\n\nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel  or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.\n\nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. \n\nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.\n\nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. \n\nCrossing happens when 2 or more almost mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a 90 percent change of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation.

A seismic prospector will tell you the ores in the surrounding chunk in a handy book you can read, and also the oil in the oilfields beneath each 8x8 chunks.\n\nTo determine which kind of oil or gas there is in the chunk you need to scan the soil by right clicking an Advanced Seismic Prospector with 2 Powderbarrels, 4 Glyceryl Trinitate cells, 8 iTNT or 16 TNT.  Make sure you wait a few seconds after placing the prospector before applying the explosives.\n\nThen use a Data Stick to extract the data by right clicking on it after the animation has finished.\n\nNow you need to put the analyzed data stick in a GT scanner.

In general, anything above 300 is really good. The total amount in the chunk is complicated. \n\nOre locations are given as the center of the chunk.

Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! These breeding lines do not cover every option or even the best, but are great starts to get you into Forestry.\n\nIT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DO YOUR FORESTRY TREE BREEDING IN AN ENCLOSED AREA, OR UNDERGROUND. BUTTERFLIES ARE A KNOWN LAG SOURCE.\n\nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination.\n\nGirth - The width of your tree.  Wider trees have more leaves, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. Butternut already provides 2x2 girth.\n\nHeight - Controls how high the tree grows. Jungle trees are already Larger, but if you want Largest there is a guide to getting Cocobolo trees. There are rumors of rare villagers with Giant Sequoia saplings capable of reaching into the clouds...\n\nMatures - The growth speed of a sapling into a tree.  Important if you plan to cut it down right away for logs.\n\nSaplings - Chance of getting a sapling from a detroyed leaf. Balsa, a tree on the way to Cocobolo, has High number of saplings. Good for making into biomass or other uses.\n\nSappiness - The amount of biomass a sapling produces in the Fermenter. Boost Fermenter output more using honey or fruit juice. Blue Mahoe provides the highest sappiness, but Lemon and Plum are respectable.\n\nYield - Chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf. Plum is the best here.\n\nFruit - Each fruit from various trees provides different advantages. Lemons are great sources of Fruit Juice but don't provide much Mulch for the fermenter. On the other hand, Plum is a mediocre source of Fruit Juice, but great for Mulch. The best seedoil nut is coconut, but butternut or hazelnut are good alternatives.\n\nWhen breeding these trees for quests, you will need to breed the species \"pure\", not a hybrid."}},"tasks":[{"index":0,"taskID":"bq_standard:checkbox"}],"rewards":{}},{"questID":1116,"preRequisites":[1117],"properties":{"betterquesting":{"snd_complete":"minecraft:entity.player.levelup","taskLogic":"AND","partySingleReward":0,"visibility":"NORMAL","isMain":0,"simultaneous":0,"icon":{"id":"Forestry:beeQueenGE","Count":1,"tag":{"MaxH":10,"Mate":{"Chromosomes":[{"UID1":"forestry.speciesCultivated","UID0":"forestry.speciesCultivated","Slot":0},{"UID1":"forestry.speedFast","UID0":"forestry.speedFast","Slot":1},{"UID1":"forestry.lifespanShortest","UID0":"forestry.lifespanShortest","Slot":2},{"UID1":"forestry.fertilityNormal","UID0":"forestry.fertilityNormal","Slot":3},{"UID1":"forestry.toleranceNone","UID0":"forestry.toleranceNone","Slot":4},{"UID1":"forestry.boolFalse","UID0":"forestry.boolFalse","Slot":5},{"UID1":"forestry.toleranceNone","UID0":"forestry.toleranceNone","Slot":7},{"UID1":"forestry.boolFalse","UID0":"forestry.boolFalse","Slot":8},{"UID1":"forestry.boolFalse","UID0":"forestry.boolFalse","Slot":9},{"UID1":"forestry.flowersVanilla","UID0":"forestry.flowersVanilla","Slot":10},{"UID1":"forestry.floweringSlowest","UID0":"forestry.floweringSlowest","Slot":11},{"UID1":"forestry.territoryAverage","UID0":"forestry.territoryAverage","Slot":12},{"UID1":"forestry.effectNone","UID0":"forestry.effectNone","Slot":13}]},"Health":10,"IsAnalyzed":1,"Genome":{"Chromosomes":[{"UID1":"forestry.speciesCultivated","UID0":"forestry.speciesCultivated","Slot":0},{"UID1":"forestry.speedFast","UID0":"forestry.speedFast","Slot":1},{"UID1":"forestry.lifespanShortest","UID0":"forestry.lifespanShortest","Slot":2},{"UID1":"forestry.fertilityNormal","UID0":"forestry.fertilityNormal","Slot":3},{"UID1":"forestry.toleranceNone","UID0":"forestry.toleranceNone","Slot":4},{"UID1":"forestry.boolFalse","UID0":"forestry.boolFalse","Slot":5},{"UID1":"forestry.toleranceNone","UID0":"forestry.toleranceNone","Slot":7},{"UID1":"forestry.boolFalse","UID0":"forestry.boolFalse","Slot":8},{"UID1":"forestry.boolFalse","UID0":"forestry.boolFalse","Slot":9},{"UID1":"forestry.flowersVanilla","UID0":"forestry.flowersVanilla","Slot":10},{"UID1":"forestry.floweringSlowest","UID0":"forestry.floweringSlowest","Slot":11},{"UID1":"forestry.territoryAverage","UID0":"forestry.territoryAverage","Slot":12},{"UID1":"forestry.effectNone","UID0":"forestry.effectNone","Slot":13}]}},"Damage":0,"OreDict":""},"snd_update":"minecraft:entity.player.levelup","repeatTime":-1,"globalShare":1,"questLogic":"AND","name":"Breed some cultivated bees","isGlobal":0,"lockedProgress":0,"autoClaim":0,"isSilent":0,"desc":"Common Princess and Foresty Drone can be bred to cultivated bees. \n\nCultivated bees have the shorest lifespan - this means they make great princesses to breed with your newly bred drones.

Fusion can reach levels close to eight times that with the right setup. For your first reactor, you will need a controller, 2-16 fluid input hatches, 1-16 fluid output hatches, and 16 energy hatches. All hatches have to be LuV tier or better. Each hatch provides 2048eu/t for the recipe, and has a storage capacity of 160M eu. This means you can do any fusion recipe that takes less than 32768eu/t or less, and has a startup of 160M eu or less. Using more fluid hatches means you need less fusion casings.

If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.\n\nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer.  You can select any crop available and discover which crossbreeds have high chances.\n\nYou can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click \"process\" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.\n\nWhen trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its weight. But more specifically, you want to maximize the proportion of its weight out of all the weights. To determine the best crops to breed, look at their attributes.  Parent crops that share more attributes with a crossbreed increase its chances. This means there are no benefits to breeding 3 or 4 identical crops together instead of 2, since all weights are increased evenly.  \n\nUse the crops guide at https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-Crops for more details.\n\nTry a variety of combinations to get the crops you want. Often, breeding together two of the same crop is a surprisingly good option or even the best one.

This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. Mandrake is grown from Mandrake Seeds which may be obtained by breaking tall grass, or by breaking a partially (or fully) grown Mandrake plant.\n\nBreaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).\n\nBelladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant.

When full grown the plant may be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.\n\nGarlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.\n\nWolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant.

Take the EU/t of your dynamo hatch, and select a rotor that has (optimal gas flow * efficiency) that is close. Now, setting up the fluid regulator is hard. The easiest way is to let in 1 L/t and use the hand-scanner to tell you the optimal flow rate. Otherwise divide the optimal gas flow by the EU/L of your gas and round down. \n\nFor example, if we are using a normal vibrant alloy turbine with 1800 EU/t optimal gas flow and 115 percent efficiency with benzene. \n1800/288 = 6.25\nRounded down that is 6L/t.  6 * 288 * 1.15 = 1987, perfect for an EV dynamo.\nOther gases may output slightly higher or lower EU depending on how close to optimal they can reach. For example refinery gas\n1800/160 = 11.25\n11 * 160 * 1.15 = 2024, still OK for an EV dynamo\nHowever hydrogen at 20 EU/L is dangerous because\n1800/20 = 90\n90 * 20 * 1.15 = 2070, above 2048, so BOOOOM.

First, you'll need a few things, the Quantum Computer itself, a huge energy hatch several amps of UV or above, this is because as Computer Racks, that'll be explained later on down here, will continuously increase the demand of energy input for every new Computer Rack that you add on. The Multiblock also consumes a large amount of energy by itself. Another important factor is ONLY turn on the Quantum Computer once you have the desired recipes for the Research Station ready to avoid excess energy loss. In order for you to build this absolute monster, you'll need to place down the Quantum Computer at least 1 block above the surface/ground and use the Multiblock Machine Blueprint, this will give you a hefty amount of information and various ghost-like blocks that'll show where casings and or hatches should go.\n\nComputation:\nComputation is generated every second and is based on the tier of your circuit. There are, however, differences in between how much computation is generated, even with the same exact tier. For instance, you could use a Master Quantum Computer (Quantum Circuit Series / LuV) or a Wetwareprocessor (Wetware Circuit Series / LuV) which will give you more Computation even though they are of the same tier. If you wish to find out exactly how much Computation a circuit gives; place down a Computer Rack, put a circuit inside and scan it. It will include the following information\nBase computation: \nAfter overclocking: <numbers, same as above unless you specially overclock it>\nHeat Accumulated: <numbers, based on circuits and heat vents, keep a watchful eye on this part as it's extremely important>\n\nComputer Racks:\nThe main component within the multiblock to generate Computation. In order to achieve this, you will need to input some circuits and heat vents; Advanced Heat Vents work best. It is critical that you use Heat Vents to prevent the heat from reaching a catastrophic point, 55 percent or above should be avoided for safety reasons. Technically, you could achieve \"55 percent\" in your Computer Racks, but in reality, they could explode around 4000-4999 heat. In order to precisely find out how much heat, you'll need a Parametrizer, which will be explained later. Now that you've understood one of the more basic concepts and safety of handling within the Computer Racks (scan the Racks before you run the Quantum Computer!), what are the more optimal setups for your Quantum Computer? Do keep in mind that even a 128 min Computation / Sec setup can complete practically 3/4th's of the recipes within the Research Station. In this case, a 4 Computer Rack setup with 1 Advanced Heat Vent and 3 Wetwareprocessors (LuV) will generate 72 Computation every second; leading up to a maximum of 288 Computation every second at just 5 amps of UV (524,288 EU/t) with only 4 Computer Racks required. This is a rather minimal setup compared to some of the more complicated setups.\n\nAnd most importantly: DO NOT WRENCH THE COMPUTER RACKS IF THEY HAVE HEAT IN THEM. Scan them before anything else! Otherwise, you're going to get an explosion.\n\nUncertainty Resolver\nMuch like a puzzle-solving simulation, it is rather complicated to explain how to solve it, but it's often best just to retrace or undo certain actions and hope for the best. Sometimes, the Schr�dinger Status will require some puzzle solving again after a period of time. This is random and incredibly frustrating especially during operations being done between the Research Station and Quantum Computer(s), so it is important to constantly check the Uncertainty Resolver before you start operations on your Computer.\n\nNow that you understand some of this, it is time to build the Computer!

Also, sending too high voltage to a machine will cause a near-instant explosion.\n\nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a wire does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA generator that supplys 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than full voltage.  For example, macerators doing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run 4 or 5 off of a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. But be careful!

There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!\n\nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! Once you unlock the bee breeding lines, look around and pick and choose which bees really interest you. The way the breeding is done is mostly left to right, and top down. Some of the lines at the bottom might look simple, but they will require bees further up to complete first. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown here.\n\nBees have two sets of traits, one active that has effects on how the bee lives, and one Inactive but can be used for breeding. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the target bee. You can breed the bees with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. You can't see the passive traits using a Field Kit, you'll need a Beealyzer. For lots of bees, you can scan them first using a GT scanner, but you'll still need a Beealyzer to see passive traits.\n\nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee.  A bee that has little or no crossbreeding potential, but has all the traits you prefer - short life, nocturnal, cavedwelling, rain tolerant, humidity, temperature, high fertility, etc.  Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.\n\nWhen you are trying for a new bee, what you are wanting is a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding stock\" princess for easy breeding, but the drone to get the new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poor crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown out if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Ignoble bees are good for this, since they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles - frames can let them live longer. Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine.\n\nOnce you get a new species, it will replace all of one of the two sets of traits of the bee.  For example when you get a Cultivated, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated! All the quests will require purebred species. \n\nGenerally all traits can be bred into any bee species, including effects or flower preference. Species generally require their preferred biome to produce their special drops.\n\nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances, or to lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for that pristine princess to become ignoble!\n\nIt looks complex, because it is! But it also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!"}},"tasks":[{"index":0,"taskID":"bq_standard:checkbox"}],"rewards":{}},{"questID":2210,"preRequisites":[189],"properties":{"betterquesting":{"snd_complete":"minecraft:entity.player.levelup","taskLogic":"AND","partySingleReward":0,"visibility":"NORMAL","isMain":0,"simultaneous":0,"icon":{"id":"minecraft:milk_bucket","Count":1,"Damage":0,"OreDict":""},"snd_update":"minecraft:entity.player.levelup","repeatTime":-1,"globalShare":1,"questLogic":"AND","name":"§a§lDealing with Radiation","isGlobal":0,"lockedProgress":0,"autoClaim":0,"isSilent":0,"desc":"Nuclear materials cause two types of radiation effects.
