Second-screen assistant for GTNH.
## Features (goals)
- Quests from BetterQuesting
  - A similar view to the BetterQuesting interface
  - Get more details for individual quests
    - What quests **from other questlines** it requires
    - What quests **from other questlines** it unlocks
  - **See quests that are locked for you in-game**
- Recipes. *See [RecEx](https://github.com/bigbass1997/RecEx) for which sources are supported*
  - Fast search *(if feasible)*
  - Pin recipes to the side *(for when you are crafting something, but with NEI you keep forgetting what the steps were, and have to keep searching for the different items, or going through the whole crafting chain with R)*

The features in bold are those that made me make this, becuase they are currently not available in-game.
